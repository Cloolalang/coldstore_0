          Rule1 triggers alarms from either senor, (either for upper of lower setpoints):


Rule1 ON Tele-DS18B20-1#Temperature>%Mem1% DO Backlog Power1 1; Publish stat/coldstore_0/ALARM {"DS18B201overtemp":"1"} ENDON ON Tele-DS18B20-2#Temperature>%Mem3% DO Backlog Power1 1; Publish stat/coldstore_0/ALARM {"DS18B202overtemp":"1"} ENDON ON Tele-DS18B20-1#Temperature<%Mem2% DO Backlog Power1 1; Publish stat/coldstore_0/ALARM {"DS18B201undertemp":"1"} ENDON ON Tele-DS18B20-2#Temperature<%Mem4% DO Backlog Power1 1; Publish stat/coldstore_0/ALARM {"DS18B202undertemp":"1"} ENDON 







          Rule 2 sends a alarm cancel every 25secs after teleperiod (if any sensor is still outside any setpoint, it will be re-riggered) and pubs LWT online:


Rule2 ON Tele-DS18B20-1 DO Ruletimer1 25 ENDON ON rules#timer=1 DO Backlog Power1 0; Publish stat/coldstore_0/ALARM {"DS18B201undertemp":"0"}  ENDON ON Tele-DS18B20-2 DO Ruletimer1 25 ENDON ON rules#timer=1 DO Backlog Power1 0; Publish stat/coldstore_0/ALARM {"DS18B202undertemp":"0"}; Publish tele/coldstore_0/LWT Online ENDON
